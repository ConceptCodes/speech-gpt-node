Just hear me out imagine you and bro are on a train up to the usual shenanigans and tom fulleury
Y'all are cruising a solid hundo mph
You look at some NPC outside who quickly eats at a site
Then you look at bro who's with you on the train you and bro see each other as stationary
This because you and bro are also moving at a hundo mph with the train
But since you and bro and all the other NPCs in the train are moving at that speed relative to the train you are stationary
Relative to outside your jit cruising. This is relative motion come in no facts in Einstein's time
But at some point my bro Einstein was like hold up what about light photons move like super fast
You know so maybe like time just hits different some said what is bro yapping about claiming cat whilst other proclaimed
Let him cook and let's just say bro turned the heat to medium high imagine a light clock
This light clock literally has two mirrors facing each other and a light beam
Skibby bopping back and forth you are on earth chillin with your light clock your bro is on a spaceship
Jit cruising, but he also has a light clock since bro is jit cruising relative to you who's not moving
That means the light clock is moving faster with him because relative to his speed everything is
stationary but unproblemo arises see in the late 1800s the Michelson Morley experiment kind of proved that the speed of light is
Constant and doesn't change no matter what like a real g. It's the cosmic speed limit
And let's just say the boys in blue are every which way so you are stationary
But bro is moving each with light clocks even though bro is moving bro's light clock can't go faster than the speed of light
But from his perspective it's still going the same speed
What the frick light can't move faster than the cosmic speed limit
So something has to take the repercussion and something does
See in order for bro's clock to move on time time itself needs to slow down to make up for it
So you don't exceed the speed limit as you travel faster and faster time literally slows down period
But there's even more out-of-pocket stuff since time jit stretches and contracts depending with speed time like space
Deserved its own dimension in fact Einstein yapped that the two were the same thing
Bro proclaimed they form a four-dimensional space called space time
Imagine space time as a blankie
So if we put a massive gat like the Sun on the space time blankie
It bends it and so anything that goes close enough just starts moving around it like any basic simp
But also since any given gat is more dense and therefore more massive the closer you get to the center of said got the faster
You're moving so if you're on earth's gat time moves slower than if you're in the atmosphere
Yeah, that's also what happens in interstellar BT dubs the planet had a level 10 gap
So they were technically moving faster while they were close to it
So they experience time slower jit crazy. No, let me give you one more vibe check with that photon clock from earlier
This should tie it all together say the photon clock takes one second each hit to say your bro is on a spaceship again
floating above the earth's gat and you are on a small hill above the earth's surface both you and your bro see
Some guy falling from space with a photon clock because guy is moving compared to you and bro
Bro's clock is moving and triangle sorts
This means the light literally travels a longer distance
Structuring how long a second is the duration of a second is directly proportional to the speed of the falling guy
So as he falls further to the earth's gat the duration of a second is longer from his perspective
And for you time would appear from the hill to pass slower than bro in the spaceship because you're closer to the center
Like we previously yapped about therefore you would see guy hit earth's gat before your bro in the spaceship
jit crazy no cap so after Einstein squabbled all that everyone finally admitted he wasn't capping and was in fact the goat
Rizzler of all rizzlers and thus the theory of special relativity was declared universally bussing
(upbeat music)
